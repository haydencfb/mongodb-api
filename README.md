  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## This is a local API that runs through MongoDB. This API is a social media platform that allows a user to have friends, thoughts, and post reactions to other users (or their own) thoughts!

  - My motivation for making this was to learn how to interact with MongoDB on a more efficient level as well as learn the efficacy of its functionality in a fullstack setting.
  - I built this project to become more comfortable with MongoDB.
  - This project solves the problems I had been having with MongoDB in my understanding. Furthermore, this project also solves the problem of learning how to develop my own API from scratch.
  - I learned how to interact with MongoDB and how to build my own API from scratch.
